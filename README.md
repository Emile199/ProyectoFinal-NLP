# ProyectoFinal-NLP

The project is a multimodal model that classifies films as fresh (good) or rotten (bad), depending on the review that a critic gave to a film and the information of the film.<br />

This project can help you to get acquainted with the transformers library<br />

The multimodal model is based on the example from: Training a BertWithTabular Model for Clothing Review Recommendation Prediction. Available at the following link<br />
https://colab.research.google.com/github/georgianpartners/Multimodal-Toolkit/blob/master/notebooks/text_w_tabular_classification.ipynb <br />

To get started with the project you must download the notebook file and upload it to Google Colab in order to use the GPU execution environment that is required to run the code. <br />

You also need to take into account the requirements.txt file, which helps us to replicate the environment that was used to run the code. <br />
